"1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host.

We try to be considerate but we live upstairs so there will be some noise. We are happy to help out in any way. My dogs are very sweet but they may bark at you when you arrive (they get very excited and assume you are coming to see them). There is a very nice front deck that you are welcome to enjoy. It is located right next to the upstairs front door. Since you have your own private entrance and access to the lockbox key it is possible that we completely miss each other for the entire stay. The key will be located in a lock box (the code is provided once you book). Also there is a door in your bedroom that leads to our back yard but it can be locked so we can not enter your space. Please stay on your side of the gate until you have had a chance to meet our dogs as they share the back yard.",2015-014318STR,12/1/2019,

We appreciate your efforts to remain in “good standing” as a host by filing your quarterly reports in a timely manner, and by operating your rental in a manner that respects the quality of life for the surrounding neighborhood. As such, you are eligible for an abbreviated renewal process of your certificate. If you wish to continue hosting short-term rentals for an additional two year period, you are still the permanent resident of the unit where you conduct short-term rentals, and the information that you submitted with your initial application is still valid, you may renew your certificate by filling out and mailing the attached form, along with the standard application fee of $250.00. We sent out renewal notifications two months ago and as of now have yet to receive yours. As of now your renewal is late, however that is not an immediate issue if we act with haste and purpose to get this renewal done promptly. If you are not conducting short-term rentals please let us know and we can close out your certificate appropriately.  I’ve attached the form we sent via snail mail for quick reference.   Let me know if you have any further questions.  For reference your STR # is STR-00214 Registration Date: 4/10/2015 Expiration Date 4/09/2017  Peter    Peter Byrne Office of Short Term Rentals  Office of Short Term Rentals, City and County of San Francisco 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94103 Direct: 415-575-8725 Fax: 415-558-6409 Email: Peter.Byrne@sfgov.org Web: www.sfgov.org/OSTR  ",2015-003384STR,7/5/2017,

You may not continue to honor pending reservations.  Please do NOT remove/modify any living spaces/kitchen counters/sinks/stoves without approval from both the Department of Building Inspection and Planning Department.  If the host legalizes the space as an Accessory Dwelling Unit, it would NOT be eligible to register to host short-term rentals (only the space where the host actually resides would be eligible).   If the host legalizes the space by removing un-permitted elements, if applicable, the host can re-apply to host short-term rentals through a new application; but only after all associated permits are both issued and completed (final inspections). Please note that even if the building complaint is closed the entire property must be in compliance with the Planning Code’s Rooms Down Bulletin  if the host wishes to re-apply to host short-term rentals.          •	What about monthly rentals instead? While you are allowed to legally host/offer/advertise 30-day minimum stays (per rental reservation) while a short-term rental certificate is suspended, it is your responsibility to ensure that any spaces (e.g. bedrooms, kitchens [with or without stoves], stairwells and decks) were legally permitted by the Department of Building Inspection.  If you choose to offer monthly stays while your registration is suspended, then cancel all pending reservations for stays of less than 30 days, and also change your online listing booking calendars to clearly show a 30-day minimum. 	  •	Violations/complaints due to the prior property owner, adjacent TIC co-owner, or landlord (if you are a tenant): Even if the complaint is due to an issue related to a prior property owner (or another TIC co-owner, or the landlord if you are a tenant), the host/applicant/property owner is still responsible for ensuring the property is free of complaints.   •	Please do not visit the Office of Short-Term Rentals to discuss this notice without an appointment.    Thank you for your attention to this notice. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact the staff contact listed at the top of this notice. ",2016-003489STR,5/8/2018,

Any way of submitting now?    On Thu, Oct 24, 2019 at 1:01 PM City & County of San Francisco | Office of Short-Term Rentals <shorttermrentals@sfgov.org> wrote: Due October 31st: Report your short-term rental stays from July, August, and September. View this email in your browser city-hall-icon SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS Quarterly report due this month Dear host,  As the third quarter of 2019 has ended, you have until the end of the October 2019 to report any short-term rentals that took place at your home between July 1st and September 30th. Late reports are not counted towards compliance.  If you have already mailed in a report, please disregard this e-mail.  Important reminders: To remain in good standing, you must still report quarterly stays to our Office, even if you use a hosting platform (website) that remits hotel taxes for you. This is a separate requirement from tax reporting.   In addition, if you have had no short-term stays this last quarter, you still need to indicate no guest stays in your quarterly reports.   A few notes  REPORTING HOSTED vs. UNHOSTED GUEST STAYS Hosted stays are guest stays where you are staying overnight in the same legal dwelling unit when the guest stays are occurring.     Unhosted guest stays are guest stays where you are not present overnight during the guest stay (limit of 90 cumulative unhosted rentals per calendar year).  OBSERVE GROUP HOUSING LIMITS This is a general reminder that City's short-term rental program is not intended to serve as a vehicle to operate a home in a manner similar to a tourist hostel (which is not generally associated with primary residential use and character). So for example, if the host is present overnight throughout the year in the residential unit, they may not typically host more than five (5) simultaneous distinct renters (whether long-term or short-term) in the same residential unit. For the purpose of this example, a couple sharing a bedroom and a single reservation would count as one distinct renter toward the limit.  DAYTIME EVENTS/MEETINGS Some hosts use online platforms to rent out portions of their home for ongoing daytime events such as photo shoots, ceremonies, or off-site meetings. Note, this type of activity may violate the Planning Code as the space being used is intended for residential use.  DETACHED SHEDS/GARAGES Short-term rentals, including overnight sleeping areas, may only be hosted in areas approved for residential use. Short-term rentals may not be conducted in garden sheds, garages, or recreational vehicles (RVs).  HOSTING SUGGESTION Please consider using trash cans with lids on top, in the bathrooms used by short-term rental guests, and encourage guests to avoid flushing items that may lead to sewage overflows. For more information visit the SFPUC's website at: https://www.sfwater.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=9307  REPORT STAYS NOW Your report is due by October 31st.  If you have questions regarding quarterly reporting, contact us at shorttermrentals@sfgov.org or (415) 575-9179. Please note that late reports are not accepted.   To complete your report, you'll need: Your email address and password (remember to use the e-mail address we have on file). The names of any sites used to list your rental during the quarter (e.g. Airbnb, FlipKey, VRBO, MisterBandb) The URL of any listing The check-in & check-out dates of all rental stays at your address during the quarter   If it's your first time reporting online, you'll need to activate your online account first: Enter the registration number from your STR certificate. Do not use the business account number from the Tax Collector. You'll receive an email with a link to set a password. Once you've set your password, select Report Stays Now to file. ACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT NOW Are you having an issue filing your report? If you are having technical difficulties, and find it necessary to submit a paper form, completed reporting forms can be dropped off Monday-Friday, 8:30AM-5PM, or mailed (envelope must be postmarked or dropped off by no later than October 31, 2019) to:  Office of Short-Term Rentals C/O: Kevin Guy 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94103.  You may also fill out the form and email your completed form via PDF to Shorttermrentals@sfgov.org  If you no longer plan to host short-term rentals please: 1. Remove any online listings offering rentals for less than 30 days and cancel any pending reservations for stays of less than 30 days. 2. E-mail shorttermrentals@sfgov.org and indicate your name, home address, and a statement that you are withdrawing your short-term residential rental certificate.  3.

At 800 square feet, it’s a cozy place to kick back and be comfortable.

There are wonderful neighbors and a lot of street parking right in front of the house. Enjoy easy access to downtown by bus and train. There’s also easy access to highway 280 if you need to go to the Silicon Valley.  There are plenty of options to travel around the city and beyond starting right at the corner. If you're here for business you can reach downtown in 20 minutes during commute hours. There is an express bus that picks you up right on the corner. Access to 280 (if you're working in the Silicon Valley) is easy too.  Other Things to Note Please remember that you will be staying in a home, not a hotel.

"1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.

Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.

We appreciate your efforts to remain in “good standing” as a host by filing your quarterly reports in a timely manner, and by operating your rental in a manner that respects the quality of life for the surrounding neighborhood. As such, you are eligible for an abbreviated renewal process of your certificate. If you wish to continue hosting short-term rentals for an additional two year period, you are still the permanent resident of the unit where you conduct short-term rentals, and the information that you submitted with your initial application is still valid, you may renew your certificate by filling out and mailing the attached form, along with the standard application fee of $250.00. We sent out renewal notifications two months ago and as of now have yet to receive yours. As of now your renewal is late, however that is not an immediate issue if we act with haste and purpose to get this renewal done promptly. If you are not conducting short-term rentals please let us know and we can close out your certificate appropriately.  I’ve attached the form we sent via snail mail for quick reference.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  For reference your:  STR # is STR-00216 Registration Date: 4/10/2015 Expiration Date 4/09/2017  Peter    Peter Byrne Office of Short Term Rentals  Office of Short Term Rentals, City and County of San Francisco 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94103 Direct: 415-575-8725 Fax: 415-558-6409 Email: Peter.Byrne@sfgov.org Web: www.sfgov.org/OSTR  ",2015-003412STR,7/5/2017,

The back garden is gorgeous, and a great place to enjoy the evening or early morning coffee. We were really disappointed that our booking was for a 3-bedroom/entire home rental, but on arrival learned we had access to only two bedrooms while the owner occupied the third. One bed was quite comfortable, while the other had little more than a futon. Linens and towels were provided as described, and the rules of the house were clear and easy to follow. Much is within walking distance, and a bus stop is nearby on Geary, as are many cafes and restaurants. Check-in and out were very flexible and was appreciated.   ",2015-006647STR,2/12/2019,

"Hi Lynne,  1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host.

"Hi Pearl Ong.   This is Omar Masry with the Office of Short-Term Rentals at the City of San Francisco.   It appears your 2 year certificate to host short-term rentals has expired (expired March 1, 2018).    So, you will need to cease advertising/hosting stays of less than 30 days; and provide us proof of no pending reservations within 4 days by sending us screenshots of your individual monthly booking calendars for March 2018 through July 2018 showing no pending stays of less than 30 days. An example is attached.    As there appears to be an un-permitted living space (kitchen sink, kitchen counter and range); which has been the subject of current and prior building complaints, we will NOT be able to consider a new application until you FULLY resolve the matter with Building (and Planning). Building will likely contact you shortly.    Please do NOT physically remove any elements from the property unless such action is subject to a proper building permit that has ALSO been reviewed by the Planning Department (review the Rooms Down Bulletin).    OMAR MASRY, AICP | SENIOR ANALYST Office of Short Term Rentals, City & County of San Francisco  omar.masry@sfgov.org  Phone: 415.575.9116 1650 Mission Street | 4th Floor | San Francisco | CA 94103  https://shorttermrentals.sfgov.org",2015-018445STR,3/5/2018,

Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. It appears you were illegally hosting short-term rentals after the expiration.  You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval.

"It appears your 2 year certificate expired JULY 27 2018 with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly). Therefore it appears you were illegally hosting short-term rentals.  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration.  You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.   If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled.  Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host.   If you are using another service you can apply through our website at shorttermrentals.sfgov.org     Office of Short Term Rentals  | City & County of San Francisco   shorttermrentals@sfgov.org     |  (415) 575-9179 1650 Mission Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103  https://shorttermrentals.sfgov.org | Learn More About Registration Here Press Release: City Attorney Pursues $5.5 million penalty for illegal short-term rentals Press Release: City Attorney sues owners of illegal hotel     Albert Kwan <albert.e.kwan@gmail.com> Today, 3:22 PM CPC-ShortTermRentals  	 This message is from outside the City email system.

At 4AM this morning Airbnb - the only platform we rent through - canceled all future reservations stating that your office had stated that our listing no longer meets the requirements for registration. I am at work right now and dont have my registration number at the office but our home address is 254 and 256 28th St, San Francisco, CA. 94131.  Its possible the problem is with my SF business license #0305878. Ee received a otic from the Treasures Office several months ago about the addresses on the license and spent a couple of days shuttle around the Treasures Office fixing the issue. My license is up to date and, according to the Treasurer, should be active to cover my medical practice at 909 Hyde St and our short term home rental at 254 28th St.   I am hoping to does resolve this problem as soon as possible - Airbnb canceled guests coming next week. Even more than the loss of income the guests who stay with us are often visiting family in the neighborhood or are students with limited budgets. We pride ourselves on being welcoming ambassadors for San Francisco. Hopefully can work together to rapidly resolve this problem.

Late reports are not counted towards compliance.  If you have already mailed in a report, please disregard this e-mail.  Important reminders: To remain in good standing, you must still report quarterly stays to our Office, even if you use a hosting platform (website) that remits hotel taxes for you. This is a separate requirement from tax reporting.   In addition, if you have had no short-term stays this last quarter, you still need to indicate no guest stays in your quarterly reports.   A few notes  REPORTING HOSTED vs. UNHOSTED GUEST STAYS Hosted stays are guest stays where you are staying overnight in the same legal dwelling unit when the guest stays are occurring.     Unhosted guest stays are guest stays where you are not present overnight during the guest stay (limit of 90 cumulative unhosted rentals per calendar year).  OBSERVE GROUP HOUSING LIMITS This is a general reminder that City's short-term rental program is not intended to serve as a vehicle to operate a home in a manner similar to a tourist hostel (which is not generally associated with primary residential use and character). So for example, if the host is present overnight throughout the year in the residential unit, they may not typically host more than five (5) simultaneous distinct renters (whether long-term or short-term) in the same residential unit. For the purpose of this example, a couple sharing a bedroom and a single reservation would count as one distinct renter toward the limit.  DAYTIME EVENTS/MEETINGS Some hosts use online platforms to rent out portions of their home for ongoing daytime events such as photo shoots, ceremonies, or off-site meetings. Note, this type of activity may violate the Planning Code as the space being used is intended for residential use.  DETACHED SHEDS/GARAGES Short-term rentals, including overnight sleeping areas, may only be hosted in areas approved for residential use. Short-term rentals may not be conducted in garden sheds, garages, or recreational vehicles (RVs).  HOSTING SUGGESTION Please consider using trash cans with lids on top, in the bathrooms used by short-term rental guests, and encourage guests to avoid flushing items that may lead to sewage overflows. For more information visit the SFPUC's website at: https://www.sfwater.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=9307  REPORT STAYS NOW Your report is due by October 31st.  If you have questions regarding quarterly reporting, contact us at shorttermrentals@sfgov.org or (415) 575-9179. Please note that late reports are not accepted.   To complete your report, you'll need: Your email address and password (remember to use the e-mail address we have on file). The names of any sites used to list your rental during the quarter (e.g. Airbnb, FlipKey, VRBO, MisterBandb) The URL of any listing The check-in & check-out dates of all rental stays at your address during the quarter   If it's your first time reporting online, you'll need to activate your online account first: Enter the registration number from your STR certificate. Do not use the business account number from the Tax Collector. You'll receive an email with a link to set a password. Once you've set your password, select Report Stays Now to file. ACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT NOW Are you having an issue filing your report? If you are having technical difficulties, and find it necessary to submit a paper form, completed reporting forms can be dropped off Monday-Friday, 8:30AM-5PM, or mailed (envelope must be postmarked or dropped off by no later than October 31, 2019) to:  Office of Short-Term Rentals C/O: Kevin Guy 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94103.  You may also fill out the form and email your completed form via PDF to Shorttermrentals@sfgov.org  If you no longer plan to host short-term rentals please: 1. Remove any online listings offering rentals for less than 30 days and cancel any pending reservations for stays of less than 30 days. 2. E-mail shorttermrentals@sfgov.org and indicate your name, home address, and a statement that you are withdrawing your short-term residential rental certificate.  3.

Neighbors can contact me via e-mail, mail, or if they wish by leaving an anonymous voicemail.     OMAR MASRY, AICP | SENIOR ANALYST Office of Short Term Rentals, City & County of San Francisco  omar.masry@sfgov.org  Phone: 415.575.9116 1650 Mission Street | 4th Floor | San Francisco | CA 94103  https://shorttermrentals.sfgov.org Press Release: City Attorney sues owners of illegal hotel   (involving a fraudulent short-term rental application) in Bernal Heights where party became gunfight  Press Release: City Attorney Pursues $5.5 million penalty for illegal short-term rentals",2015-006102STR,1/23/2019,

"1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host. If you are using another service you can apply through our website at shorttermrentals.sfgov.org  Office of Short Term Rentals  | City & County of San Francisco  shorttermrentals@sfgov.org     |  (415) 575-9179 1650 Mission Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103 https://shorttermrentals.sfgov.org | Learn More About Registration Here ",2016-000633STR,2/28/2019,

"1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host.

Based on your advice I reached out to Inspector Christina Dang. While Inspector Dang is currently out of the office, we were able to meet with Senior Inspector Jose Lopez.  We provided to Mr. Lopez the invoice evidencing the work that has been completed to date and also the contract for the work that is in progress.     As mentioned, we discussed with Inspector Dang the extent of the window project and mutually agreed upon a re-inspection date of March 7.  Based on the work our contractor completes, he believes the project can be done by the end of next week. It is currently in progress. Please note that the windows are being repaired/restored and not replaced. Once completed we will be eager to advance the re-inspection for an earlier date.     Our tenant is agreeable to these terms and we have a written agreement with him to that extent. I have included Inspector Dang and Senior Inspector Lopez on this communication. Senior Inspector Lopez can include his feedback. Also included is the other property owner, my spouse, Alexey Goro.     It is our sincere hope to resolve this matter in a cooperative and efficient manner.  As an educator for the city of San Francisco, our short-term rentals provide the income we rely on to sustain ourselves.

Also, DO NOT MAIL IN PAYMENT please follow the link provided for payment processing. Effective October 1, 2019, the short-term rental application fee is $450.   Please note that this renewal is separate from any items that may be required by the Treasurer’s and Tax Collector’s Office. If any of your information has changed since your initial application, please contact our office for further details at shorttermrentals@sfgov.org<mailto:shorttermrentals@sfgov.org>, or via phone at 415-575-9179. Our email and voicemail are constantly monitored by our staff, and we are happy to assist you. Thank you for your cooperation, and for continuing to operate as a responsible short-term rental host in San Francisco. Failure to renew will prohibit you from advertising and hosting Short-Term Rental CLICK HERE TO RENEW< https://businessportal.sfgov.org/forms/short-term-rental-renewal-intro If You Decide to Stop Hosting Short-Term Rentals 1.      Remove all (online) listings that advertise your short-term rental, and cancel pending short-term rental reservations for stays of less than 30 days. 2.      Fill out this form with the Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector<https://etaxstatement.sfgov.org/accountupdate> to declare that you are no longer hosting. 3.      Complete this form <http://sfassessor.org/forms-notices/forms/request-business-account-closure> with the Office of the Assessor-Recorder. Depending on the date of your business closure, you may still need to declare business personal property taxes for the current year. Business personal property taxes are separate from hotel taxes (transient occupancy taxes). 4.

No, they are not automatic. Is the fee the same?   Effective October 1, 2019 the short-term rental application fee is $450. If my listing is being blocked by Airbnb/VRBO/HomeAway, what should I do? After submitting your application, please e-mail us with your street address, name, and the listing information (listing identification number or listing description). We will ask the website (hosting platform) to re-list the listing for you. Do I need to provide all new dual proofs of residency? Yes, please. What should I do if there are unresolved Building Code/Planning Code/Fire Code complaints against my property? You may not continue to host/advertise/offer short-term rentals. Please work with Building/Fire/Planning to resolve the complaint. Please do not re-apply until after the complaint has been fully resolved (including final inspections of any building permits, if required, to resolve the complaint). Does this have anything to do with hotel taxes (transient occupancy taxes), or the 571-R form I received in the mail?  No, it does not. While you still need to maintain a separate business registration certificate with the SF Treasurer and Tax Collector's Office, the collection of hotel taxes, or business personal property taxes (tied to the 571-R form host receive by USPS mail) is handled separately with their Office. Our Office (OSTR) cannot provide tax advice. If you have questions about issues related to hotel taxes and business registration, please call SF 311, or visit the Tax Collector at the 1st floor at City Hall. The 571-R form (for business personal property taxes) is administered by the Assessor-Recorder's Office (which is located at the 1st floor of City Hall. in a different room than the Tax Collector's office). MILTON MARTIN, PLANNER TECH Office of Short Term Rentals, City & County of San Francisco 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94103 Direct: 415-575-9052│Fax: 415-558-6409 Email: milton.martin@sfgov.org Web: https://shorttermrentals.sfgov.org   The Planning Department is open for business during the Stay Safe at Home Order.

"Hi. A couple items I would like to share.   You referred to the property as a multi-unit building. There was a previous history of illegal units in the basement back in 2013.   I don't get the sense there's only one kitchen at the property now. If you believe otherwise, feel free to let me know or call me.   Semi-separately:     The City's short-term rental program does NOT require the owner to live on-site.     So for instance, a long-term renter may apply as well (about 11% of our approved hosts are renters); as long as they actually live in the same dwelling unit at least 275 nights per year. So hypothetically, a renter could rent a 6 bedroom house, get a certificate from our Office, live year-round, in one bedroom, and have 5 different Airbnb private room listings for 5 different couples (for example) staying at the same time.     In this instance, it APPEARS Brian lives on-site and was renting out 3 different private bedrooms at the same time. If you look at guest reviews there is quite a bit of mention of his mom being present. I have not conducted a site visit. I went to the site once (see below) to issue a notice of violation (posters on outside of building) and penalties were paid.    Regards,     OMAR MASRY, AICP | SENIOR ANALYST Office of Short Term Rentals, City & County of San Francisco  omar.masry@sfgov.org  Phone: 415.575.9116 1650 Mission Street | 4th Floor | San Francisco | CA 94103  https://shorttermrentals.sfgov.org Press Release: City Attorney Pursues $5.5 million penalty for illegal short-term rentals Press Release: City Attorney sues owners of illegal hotel   (involving a fraudulent application) in Bernal Heights where party became gunfight   COMPLAINTS - PLANNING DEPT: Add to map	    2016-003847ENF Omar Masry Tel: 415-575-9116 Enforcement (ENF)  848 42nd Avenue Illegal Short-Term Rentals.

The new listing ID is 33935116.

I wasn't given the opportunity to enter my STR number, even though I have it.  Anyway, I feel terrible that I may be creating work for people, but after trying for a month I gave up on ever successfully reactivating my old listing.

"To maintain good standing on the registry, all registered hosts are required to file quarterly reports every quarter, even if they didn’t host any stays for that specific quarter.  Failure to report on a consistent basis can be grounds for certificate revocation. Missing one report its not grounds for revocation, and as long as you work to file your reports going forward it should not be an issue. Currently, the online reporting is open, but we do not accept any late reporting forms. If you wish, you can file a paper report (blank form attached), and it will be added to your file, but it will not count as being on record or logged into the database; so you will not see it under your report history when you log on to your account.  ",2019-003625STR,1/7/2020,

This is a primary requirement.  If you intend to re-apply online today you have two primary options (See Item 4 for the second option) as shown below. You would need to file a new application with current application fee and recent dual proofs of residency:  Apply online through the OSTR website (skip step 1 if your business registration certificate with the Tax Collector is still valid at this address) with a complete application. http://businessportal.sfgov.org/forms/short-term-rental-intro  Short-Term Residential Rental Application | SF Business Portal businessportal.sfgov.org The San Francisco Business Portal is the ultimate resource for starting, running, and growing a business in our City.

Please note this may take between 3-10 days to go through.  However, if you only plan to host short-term rentals through Airbnb, you can also try creating a new Airbnb listing today, which will lead you to their pass-through registration program within Airbnb's website.

Number  New Registered Short-term Residential Rental Certificate # STR-0003958  Hi,  I hope you can help me. I originally applied for Short Term Rental Certification in February 2019 to help pay my share of unexpected maintenance and repairs to the flat that I have owned and lived in for 22 years. I fulfilled all the requirements, paid all the fees and opened a Business Acct.  I am over 65, have no job and was counting on being able to do short term rentals to help pay these and other fees and expenses. However, without the certification, I could do nothing.  When I still didn't have Certification by August, I finally gave up waiting and worked with someone at the City who helped me close the Business Account. so I wouldn't have to pay renewal fees (that were due after only 4 months!!!), penalties, and taxes while still waiting to be able to make any money. (I contacted the Short Term Rental office several times but each time I received a form email saying they could not tell me when or if I would receive certification. Real Estate agents told me I could not list the room in my apt without the certificate number.)     Because I still need rental revenue to help pay bills, I moved out and found someone who wanted to rent my flat furnished on a long-term (more than 30 days) basis.   I finally received my Short term Rental Certification in mid-November 2019 but now, because of the long term lease, I cannot move back until August 2020 and I no longer have an active business account number with the City.  I may never get a chance to do short term rentals but I am reluctant to cancel the certification which took so long and cost so much to get--especially since I might need to use it before November 2021.  Can you  give me some advice or information on what my options and costs might be?  Thank you, Happy Holidays!  Adrienne Mally  415-596-3366 Adrienne@a3nstrategies.com ",2019-020415STR,1/9/2020,
