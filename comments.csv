 Dear Office of Short-Term Rentals,
 
 I am writing to notify you that we will no longer host short-term rentals effective March 28, 2020.  
 1.	STR certificate number:  STR-0001233
 2.	Street address: 4 Lexington Street, San Francisco, CA 94110
 3.	Full name:  Donna Shibata and Douglas Garfinkel
 Thank you,
 Donna Shibata

"1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).
 
 Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration.
 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year. 
 3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled.
 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host. If you are using another service you can apply through our website at shorttermrentals.sfgov.org

 Hi Omar,
 
 I have not been the owner of this property for over 2 years. Could you possibly take me off this email chain?
