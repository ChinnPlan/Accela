"1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval.

Dear Kevin,  I didn’t receive the email from your office until January 31st telling me I had only until midnight on that day to report the last quarter of 2019.

"Hi. Thanks for reaching out to us. Please note the following: 1) We cannot count quarterly reports that are not submitted in time.   2) While we do not revoke certificates for a single missed quarterly report, please note that certificates can be revoked for missing multiple quarterly reports.  3) Please don't send a renewal form more than 30 days in advance. On your renewal form please indicate the change in ownership structure as a note.  Thanks and have a great weekend!   Jake Sproull <jake_sproull@yahoo.com> Yesterday, 5:02 PM ShortTermRentals, PLN (CPC) Hello,   I have Short Term Rental (STR 000 1369) that is coming up for renewal in June. Since my original registration, my building has converted from a Tenancy In Common to a condominium, and so the City changed my Lot # (the Block # is still the same, however). Is there anything I need to do on the renewal application to highlight this change? Other than the Lot #, all the other information about the property will be the same as on my original application.   Secondly, I forgot to file my most recent quarterly report by the April 30th deadline. Is there a way to file a late report, or send you the info via email? Or can include the first quarter stays with my next report?   Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide,   William Jake Sproull  174 Langton Street San Francisco, CA 94103 (415) 572 - 3746","2015-018024STR","2018-05-04 09:44:21"

"1487849	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1487849  Us My husband and and our daughter and I live in the unit upstairs with our two dogs. We try to be considerate but we live upstairs so there will be some noise. We are happy to help out in any way. My dogs are very sweet but they may bark at you when you arrive (they get very excited and assume you are coming to see them). There is a very nice front deck that you are welcome to enjoy. It is located right next to the upstairs front door. Since you have your own private entrance and access to the lockbox key it is possible that we completely miss each other for the entire stay. The key will be located in a lock box (the code is provided once you book). Also there is a door in your bedroom that leads to our back yard but it can be locked so we can not enter your space. Please stay on your side of the gate until you have had a chance to meet our dogs as they share the back yard.","2015-014318STR","2019-12-01 10:22:07"

"1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host.

Peter  From: Byrne, Peter (ADM)  Sent: Tuesday, April 25, 2017 3:06 PM To: 'melody.wendt@gmail.com' Subject: Your STR renewal  Hi Melody,  Our records indicate that you initially registered to be a short-term rental host in April of 2015.  Your initial registration was valid for a period of two years, and is up for renewal. We appreciate your efforts to remain in “good standing” as a host by filing your quarterly reports in a timely manner, and by operating your rental in a manner that respects the quality of life for the surrounding neighborhood. As such, you are eligible for an abbreviated renewal process of your certificate. If you wish to continue hosting short-term rentals for an additional two year period, you are still the permanent resident of the unit where you conduct short-term rentals, and the information that you submitted with your initial application is still valid, you may renew your certificate by filling out and mailing the attached form, along with the standard application fee of $250.00. We sent out renewal notifications two months ago and as of now have yet to receive yours. As of now your renewal is late, however that is not an immediate issue if we act with haste and purpose to get this renewal done promptly. If you are not conducting short-term rentals please let us know and we can close out your certificate appropriately.  I’ve attached the form we sent via snail mail for quick reference.   Let me know if you have any further questions.

"STR-0001336 | 642 Judah Street CPC-ShortTermRentals Roy Tahtinen <roytahtinen@yahoo.com> It appears your 2 year certificate expired MAY 22, 2018 with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).   Therefore it appears you were illegally hosting short-term rentals.  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration.  You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.   If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled.  Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host.   If you are using another service you can apply through our website at shorttermrentals.sfgov.org      Office of Short Term Rentals  | City & County of San Francisco   shorttermrentals@sfgov.org     |  (415) 575-9179 1650 Mission Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103  https://shorttermrentals.sfgov.org | Learn More About Registration Here Press Release: City Attorney Pursues $5.5 million penalty for illegal short-term rentals Press Release: City Attorney sues owners of illegal hotel   From: Roy Tahtinen <roytahtinen@yahoo.com> Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2019 1:17 PM To: CPC-ShortTermRentals Subject: STR-0001336    	 This message is from outside the City email system.

In addition, OSTR has received a complaint regarding what appears to be an unpermitted dwelling unit at the property, which has been referred to the Department of Building Inspection.  The host must immediately remove any short-term rental listings offering stays of less than 30 days (at any location at the entire property), and cancel pending reservations for stays of less than 30 days. Customer service for most online hosting platforms can cancel stays for you if you call them and explain the situation.  Please provide screenshots of your monthly booking calendars for each online listing, showing the absence of pending reservations for stays of less than 30 days, within six days from the date of this letter, to the e-mail address listed above  Continuing to host short-term rentals without a certificate can result in a notice of violation and penalties of $484 per day. You may not continue to honor pending reservations.  Please do NOT remove/modify any living spaces/kitchen counters/sinks/stoves without approval from both the Department of Building Inspection and Planning Department.  If the host legalizes the space as an Accessory Dwelling Unit, it would NOT be eligible to register to host short-term rentals (only the space where the host actually resides would be eligible).   If the host legalizes the space by removing un-permitted elements, if applicable, the host can re-apply to host short-term rentals through a new application; but only after all associated permits are both issued and completed (final inspections). Please note that even if the building complaint is closed the entire property must be in compliance with the Planning Code’s Rooms Down Bulletin  if the host wishes to re-apply to host short-term rentals.          •	What about monthly rentals instead? While you are allowed to legally host/offer/advertise 30-day minimum stays (per rental reservation) while a short-term rental certificate is suspended, it is your responsibility to ensure that any spaces (e.g. bedrooms, kitchens [with or without stoves], stairwells and decks) were legally permitted by the Department of Building Inspection.  If you choose to offer monthly stays while your registration is suspended, then cancel all pending reservations for stays of less than 30 days, and also change your online listing booking calendars to clearly show a 30-day minimum. 	  •	Violations/complaints due to the prior property owner, adjacent TIC co-owner, or landlord (if you are a tenant): Even if the complaint is due to an issue related to a prior property owner (or another TIC co-owner, or the landlord if you are a tenant), the host/applicant/property owner is still responsible for ensuring the property is free of complaints.   •	Please do not visit the Office of Short-Term Rentals to discuss this notice without an appointment.    Thank you for your attention to this notice. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact the staff contact listed at the top of this notice.

I’ve clicked on the listing you sent me and I’m assuming that’s the one the property manager was using. That listing has been recently deactivated.

"Your city registration wasn’t approved CPC-ShortTermRentals It appears your 2 year certificate expired APRIL 21, 2018 with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).   Therefore it appears you were illegally hosting short-term rentals.  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration.  You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.   If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled.  Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval.

Do not open links or attachments from untrusted sources.    Hello,  I just received this email telling me that my Airbnb listing doesn’t meet the requirements for short-term rentals in San Francisco. The reason stated is “REJECT14 - Other/Miscellaneous”.  Can you tell me the reason for this rejection? I have been hosting for several years now and I have followed all of the requirements. My address is 2524 Post Street, and when I look at the SF Property Information Map, I see that it says “Permitted Short Term Rentals: 2524 Post Street.”  Thank you very much for your help in this matter.

If you had any reservations booked for 30 consecutive days or more, those won’t be canceled. Interested in hosting guests for longer stays? You don’t need to be registered with San Francisco in order to host guests if they stay with you for more than 30 days at a time. Change the minimum stay at your listing to 30 nights or more and host long-term instead. Update your calendar Not sure why your registration was denied? You can reach out to the city and ask questions, clarify details about your application, or appeal the city’s decision. Contact the city.

View this email in your browser city-hall-icon SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS Quarterly report due this month Dear host,  As the third quarter of 2019 has ended, you have until the end of the October 2019 to report any short-term rentals that took place at your home between July 1st and September 30th. Late reports are not counted towards compliance.  If you have already mailed in a report, please disregard this e-mail.  Important reminders: To remain in good standing, you must still report quarterly stays to our Office, even if you use a hosting platform (website) that remits hotel taxes for you. This is a separate requirement from tax reporting.   In addition, if you have had no short-term stays this last quarter, you still need to indicate no guest stays in your quarterly reports.   A few notes  REPORTING HOSTED vs. UNHOSTED GUEST STAYS Hosted stays are guest stays where you are staying overnight in the same legal dwelling unit when the guest stays are occurring.     Unhosted guest stays are guest stays where you are not present overnight during the guest stay (limit of 90 cumulative unhosted rentals per calendar year).  OBSERVE GROUP HOUSING LIMITS This is a general reminder that City's short-term rental program is not intended to serve as a vehicle to operate a home in a manner similar to a tourist hostel (which is not generally associated with primary residential use and character). So for example, if the host is present overnight throughout the year in the residential unit, they may not typically host more than five (5) simultaneous distinct renters (whether long-term or short-term) in the same residential unit. For the purpose of this example, a couple sharing a bedroom and a single reservation would count as one distinct renter toward the limit.  DAYTIME EVENTS/MEETINGS Some hosts use online platforms to rent out portions of their home for ongoing daytime events such as photo shoots, ceremonies, or off-site meetings. Note, this type of activity may violate the Planning Code as the space being used is intended for residential use.  DETACHED SHEDS/GARAGES Short-term rentals, including overnight sleeping areas, may only be hosted in areas approved for residential use. Short-term rentals may not be conducted in garden sheds, garages, or recreational vehicles (RVs).  HOSTING SUGGESTION Please consider using trash cans with lids on top, in the bathrooms used by short-term rental guests, and encourage guests to avoid flushing items that may lead to sewage overflows. For more information visit the SFPUC's website at: https://www.sfwater.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=9307  REPORT STAYS NOW Your report is due by October 31st.  If you have questions regarding quarterly reporting, contact us at shorttermrentals@sfgov.org or (415) 575-9179. Please note that late reports are not accepted.   To complete your report, you'll need: Your email address and password (remember to use the e-mail address we have on file). The names of any sites used to list your rental during the quarter (e.g. Airbnb, FlipKey, VRBO, MisterBandb) The URL of any listing The check-in & check-out dates of all rental stays at your address during the quarter   If it's your first time reporting online, you'll need to activate your online account first: Enter the registration number from your STR certificate. Do not use the business account number from the Tax Collector. You'll receive an email with a link to set a password. Once you've set your password, select Report Stays Now to file. ACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT NOW Are you having an issue filing your report? If you are having technical difficulties, and find it necessary to submit a paper form, completed reporting forms can be dropped off Monday-Friday, 8:30AM-5PM, or mailed (envelope must be postmarked or dropped off by no later than October 31, 2019) to:  Office of Short-Term Rentals C/O: Kevin Guy 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94103.  You may also fill out the form and email your completed form via PDF to Shorttermrentals@sfgov.org  If you no longer plan to host short-term rentals please: 1. Remove any online listings offering rentals for less than 30 days and cancel any pending reservations for stays of less than 30 days. 2. E-mail shorttermrentals@sfgov.org and indicate your name, home address, and a statement that you are withdrawing your short-term residential rental certificate.  3.

The space  The Space This newly remodeled flat sits three blocks from Ocean Beach, between Golden Gate Park and the San Francisco Zoo.  This is a two bedroom, one bathroom space. At 800 square feet, it’s a cozy place to kick back and be comfortable. The flat offers two queen beds.  If you are here for business, the 48 Express stops on the corner and you can be downtown in 20 min. The location also offers easy 280 access.  This Ocean Beach flat is flooded with sunlight. It’s recently remodeled, and the house has a fully equipped kitchen.   There's a small porch outside of one of the bedrooms and you'll have access to the backyard. The backyard isn't so special yet; it's a work in progress. It's clean and accessible.  The owner lives in an apartment in the same property (downstairs). Your space is your own, but the owner is happy to help with anything you need. Y, se habla espanol.  Getting Around Walk on the beach, take a bus or walk to Golden Gate Park and the San Francisco Zoo. There are wonderful neighbors and a lot of street parking right in front of the house. Enjoy easy access to downtown by bus and train. There’s also easy access to highway 280 if you need to go to the Silicon Valley.  There are plenty of options to travel around the city and beyond starting right at the corner. If you're here for business you can reach downtown in 20 minutes during commute hours. There is an express bus that picks you up right on the corner. Access to 280 (if you're working in the Silicon Valley) is easy too.  Other Things to Note Please remember that you will be staying in a home, not a hotel. Therefore, we ask that you treat our space with the same respect you would show your own.

Peter  From: Byrne, Peter (ADM)  Sent: Tuesday, April 25, 2017 3:17 PM To: 'jeesirim@hotmail.com' Subject: Your STR renewal  Hi Kruawan,  Our records indicate that you initially registered to be a short-term rental host in April of 2015.  Your initial registration was valid for a period of two years, and is up for renewal. We appreciate your efforts to remain in “good standing” as a host by filing your quarterly reports in a timely manner, and by operating your rental in a manner that respects the quality of life for the surrounding neighborhood. As such, you are eligible for an abbreviated renewal process of your certificate. If you wish to continue hosting short-term rentals for an additional two year period, you are still the permanent resident of the unit where you conduct short-term rentals, and the information that you submitted with your initial application is still valid, you may renew your certificate by filling out and mailing the attached form, along with the standard application fee of $250.00. We sent out renewal notifications two months ago and as of now have yet to receive yours. As of now your renewal is late, however that is not an immediate issue if we act with haste and purpose to get this renewal done promptly. If you are not conducting short-term rentals please let us know and we can close out your certificate appropriately.  I’ve attached the form we sent via snail mail for quick reference.  Let me know if you have any further questions.

"Peter, Kevin, et. al.,  On October 31st, I moved out of 61 Buena Vista Terrace and into my new home at 551 Castro Street. I've updated my voter registration and have activated PG&E, Comcast and Dish Network at that address. I will have my motor vehicle registration updated shortly.  Unless it's possible to do so sooner, I will apply for a STR permit for my new home on December 29th.  Please close out any open permits for 61 Buena Vista Terrace.  If anyone creates a listing for that address, it's not me.  If there's anything else you'd like from me in advance of my new application, please let me know.  I expect the new application process to move forward trouble free. If it's possible to retain the same permit number (21), I'd love that, but I'm unclear what the process is when a registered permit holder moves to a new location.

This is going to be very easy for all of us; on May 28, 2018, our last Airbnb guests departed, and two days later, we moved from that property!  Since that date, my Airbnb listing has been 'snoozed' and my Calendar has been blocked off just in case of some glitch. I had only kept it online (but not visible or bookable) in order to copy and paste some of my excellent reviews as a 12-quarter Superhost, if I decided to apply for a new STR Permit in the future.  I thought I only needed to allow our STR-0000093 to expire, which it is scheduled to on March 24, 2019, just two weeks from now. I assumed my non-renewal would suffice, especially as I have not hosted anyone at the previous or present address.   Thank you for your attention to detail. I hope this letter, and verification of my deactivated Airbnb account will suffice for your purposes. Please respond to this e-mail and/or give me a quick call to confirm, and we can close this out successfully!  Sincerely,  Alexina B.

"Airbnb registration rejection CPC-ShortTermRentals Hi.   It appears your account expired and you failed to renew your certificate.   We do NOT guarantee renewals.   Especially, as it appears you failed to file multiple quarterly reports.   We sent reminders to file quarterly reports to: YVES.FIGUEROLA@IMELAVI.FR    We ALSO noted this requirement in the certificate we mailed to you over 2 years ago (since expired). Your certificate expired July 6, 2018.     Quarterly Reporting is NOT handled by hosting platforms for you.     We do not accept late reports.     As you were not in good standing your account was deactivated.    You do have a right to file a brand new application (with new application fee) and dual proofs of residency at the website link below.    It is also noted that your certificate was for 546 Haight Street; though you note a different address below.   You may only host short-term rentals in the same apartment where you also reside at least 275 nights per year; and only if you have a pending application.

The back garden is gorgeous, and a great place to enjoy the evening or early morning coffee. We were really disappointed that our booking was for a 3-bedroom/entire home rental, but on arrival learned we had access to only two bedrooms while the owner occupied the third. One bed was quite comfortable, while the other had little more than a futon. Linens and towels were provided as described, and the rules of the house were clear and easy to follow. Much is within walking distance, and a bus stop is nearby on Geary, as are many cafes and restaurants. Check-in and out were very flexible and was appreciated.

"Hi Lynne,  1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host. If you are using another service you can apply through our website at shorttermrentals.sfgov.org    MILTON MARTIN, PLANNER TECH Office of Short Term Rentals, City & County of San Francisco 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94103 Direct: 415-575-9052│Fax: 415-558-6409 Email: milton.martin@sfgov.org Web: https://shorttermrentals.sfgov.org  ","2016-007786STR","2019-03-01 16:17:44"

"hanks.   There is a serious concern that you turned one home into a full-time Airbnb un-hosted unit; and reported those stays as hosted.   Even if you live at the property, you can NOT live in one unit and turn the other into a full-time Airbnb or host any stays of less than 30 days.   Frankly, your certificate should not have been approved in the first place. The program is designed to allow LIMITED short-term rentals in the same unit where you also live at least 275 nights per year.   We cannot approve a renewal of your application.   You'll need to call Airbnb customer service and tell them to cancel stays of less than 30 days immediately, then remove any online listings offering stays of less than 30 days.    Have them provide you a confirmation memo that you e-mail to me within 1 week stating there are no short-term rentals.   Please note, that we can NOT make an exception to the City's short-term rental rules because of any medical or financial hardships (it comes up a lot).

"Hi Pearl Ong.   This is Omar Masry with the Office of Short-Term Rentals at the City of San Francisco.   It appears your 2 year certificate to host short-term rentals has expired (expired March 1, 2018).    So, you will need to cease advertising/hosting stays of less than 30 days; and provide us proof of no pending reservations within 4 days by sending us screenshots of your individual monthly booking calendars for March 2018 through July 2018 showing no pending stays of less than 30 days. An example is attached.    As there appears to be an un-permitted living space (kitchen sink, kitchen counter and range); which has been the subject of current and prior building complaints, we will NOT be able to consider a new application until you FULLY resolve the matter with Building (and Planning). Building will likely contact you shortly.    Please do NOT physically remove any elements from the property unless such action is subject to a proper building permit that has ALSO been reviewed by the Planning Department (review the Rooms Down Bulletin).

"Airbnb registration issue! #str-0001511 | 201 Randall Street CPC-ShortTermRentals Jody Richman <randallst.sf@gmail.com> It appears your 2 year certificate expired on 07/14/18 with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. It appears you were illegally hosting short-term rentals after the expiration.  You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host.

"It appears your 2 year certificate expired JULY 27 2018 with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly). Therefore it appears you were illegally hosting short-term rentals.  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration.  You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.   If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled.  Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host.   If you are using another service you can apply through our website at shorttermrentals.sfgov.org     Office of Short Term Rentals  | City & County of San Francisco   shorttermrentals@sfgov.org     |  (415) 575-9179 1650 Mission Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103  https://shorttermrentals.sfgov.org | Learn More About Registration Here Press Release: City Attorney Pursues $5.5 million penalty for illegal short-term rentals Press Release: City Attorney sues owners of illegal hotel     Albert Kwan <albert.e.kwan@gmail.com> Today, 3:22 PM CPC-ShortTermRentals  	 This message is from outside the City email system.

"John Mendelson <johnmendelson@gmail.com> Hi John   It appears you were not only illegally hosting, but even if you had RE-applied, it appears you are living in one unit at the property and turned a 3rd living space at the two (legal) dwelling unit property into a short-term rental.  This is of heightened concern given a prior 2003 complaint for an illegal unit. Had we known of the use of the space the first certificate would likely not have been issued.   It's recommended you see if the space can be legalized as an Accessory Dwelling Unit (though short-term stays of less than 30 days are not allowed in such units).

Do not open links or attachments from untrusted sources.    Dear Office of Short Term Rental,  We are long time city home owners who have been registered with your office since its inception. At 4AM this morning Airbnb - the only platform we rent through - canceled all future reservations stating that your office had stated that our listing no longer meets the requirements for registration. I am at work right now and dont have my registration number at the office but our home address is 254 and 256 28th St, San Francisco, CA. 94131.  Its possible the problem is with my SF business license #0305878. Ee received a otic from the Treasures Office several months ago about the addresses on the license and spent a couple of days shuttle around the Treasures Office fixing the issue. My license is up to date and, according to the Treasurer, should be active to cover my medical practice at 909 Hyde St and our short term home rental at 254 28th St.   I am hoping to does resolve this problem as soon as possible - Airbnb canceled guests coming next week. Even more than the loss of income the guests who stay with us are often visiting family in the neighborhood or are students with limited budgets. We pride ourselves on being welcoming ambassadors for San Francisco. Hopefully can work together to rapidly resolve this problem. My full contact data is below - my cell is 415-652-1167.

View this email in your browser city-hall-icon SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS Quarterly report due this month Dear host,  As the third quarter of 2019 has ended, you have until the end of the October 2019 to report any short-term rentals that took place at your home between July 1st and September 30th. Late reports are not counted towards compliance.  If you have already mailed in a report, please disregard this e-mail.  Important reminders: To remain in good standing, you must still report quarterly stays to our Office, even if you use a hosting platform (website) that remits hotel taxes for you. This is a separate requirement from tax reporting.   In addition, if you have had no short-term stays this last quarter, you still need to indicate no guest stays in your quarterly reports.   A few notes  REPORTING HOSTED vs. UNHOSTED GUEST STAYS Hosted stays are guest stays where you are staying overnight in the same legal dwelling unit when the guest stays are occurring.     Unhosted guest stays are guest stays where you are not present overnight during the guest stay (limit of 90 cumulative unhosted rentals per calendar year).  OBSERVE GROUP HOUSING LIMITS This is a general reminder that City's short-term rental program is not intended to serve as a vehicle to operate a home in a manner similar to a tourist hostel (which is not generally associated with primary residential use and character). So for example, if the host is present overnight throughout the year in the residential unit, they may not typically host more than five (5) simultaneous distinct renters (whether long-term or short-term) in the same residential unit. For the purpose of this example, a couple sharing a bedroom and a single reservation would count as one distinct renter toward the limit.  DAYTIME EVENTS/MEETINGS Some hosts use online platforms to rent out portions of their home for ongoing daytime events such as photo shoots, ceremonies, or off-site meetings. Note, this type of activity may violate the Planning Code as the space being used is intended for residential use.  DETACHED SHEDS/GARAGES Short-term rentals, including overnight sleeping areas, may only be hosted in areas approved for residential use. Short-term rentals may not be conducted in garden sheds, garages, or recreational vehicles (RVs).  HOSTING SUGGESTION Please consider using trash cans with lids on top, in the bathrooms used by short-term rental guests, and encourage guests to avoid flushing items that may lead to sewage overflows. For more information visit the SFPUC's website at: https://www.sfwater.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=9307  REPORT STAYS NOW Your report is due by October 31st.  If you have questions regarding quarterly reporting, contact us at shorttermrentals@sfgov.org or (415) 575-9179. Please note that late reports are not accepted.   To complete your report, you'll need: Your email address and password (remember to use the e-mail address we have on file). The names of any sites used to list your rental during the quarter (e.g. Airbnb, FlipKey, VRBO, MisterBandb) The URL of any listing The check-in & check-out dates of all rental stays at your address during the quarter   If it's your first time reporting online, you'll need to activate your online account first: Enter the registration number from your STR certificate. Do not use the business account number from the Tax Collector. You'll receive an email with a link to set a password. Once you've set your password, select Report Stays Now to file. ACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT NOW Are you having an issue filing your report? If you are having technical difficulties, and find it necessary to submit a paper form, completed reporting forms can be dropped off Monday-Friday, 8:30AM-5PM, or mailed (envelope must be postmarked or dropped off by no later than October 31, 2019) to:  Office of Short-Term Rentals C/O: Kevin Guy 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94103.  You may also fill out the form and email your completed form via PDF to Shorttermrentals@sfgov.org  If you no longer plan to host short-term rentals please: 1. Remove any online listings offering rentals for less than 30 days and cancel any pending reservations for stays of less than 30 days. 2. E-mail shorttermrentals@sfgov.org and indicate your name, home address, and a statement that you are withdrawing your short-term residential rental certificate.  3.

The host has to live in the same apartment/suite/home at least 275 nights per year. The property needs to be free of Building/Planning Complaints. The host also can't exceed more than 90 cumulative nights of UN-HOSTED stays in the same calendar year.  If they live at the same INDIVIDUAL dwelling unit, they can rent out up to five separate rooms (for example) year-round as hosted rentals, assuming they are also present living in the same unit year-round. If the owner does not live there the certificate can be revoked. I'm going to respectfully decline to go into every review method given the nature of fraud we contend with.  I'm going to respectfully decline to provide the stay reporting information due to some privacy concerns.

"970 Wisconsin Street Unit 2 CPC-ShortTermRentals Mon 7/29/2019 11:32 AM Ok.  Per the City short-term rental law, the certificate is tied to the individual person at the property.  So you'll need to re-apply with a new application and application fee (we can't pro-rate or refund) and dual proofs of residency at our website: https://businessportal.sfgov.org/forms/short-term-rental-intro in order to legally continue hosting.  Coming in-person isn't faster. You are allowed to host while your application is pending. If you create a new listing and it gets blocked then let us know so we can help. We cannot provide a timing estimate on final approval given the influx of applications.  The business registration certificate has Kenneth as the ownership of the business, but your name in the DBA field. You can leave it as is, OR create a new business registration certificate for Accommodations and short-term rentals as this address, in your name or any random business name.

"1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval. That is why it is recommended that you apply through Airbnb's website, if you are primarily using Airbnb to host.

"1.	It appears your 2 year certificate expired with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.	Given the volume of applications, and a number of challenges, we cannot given an estimate on timing for final approval.

Here are the listings (both in the same house): https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14426130  https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/plus/12741695  Both are now in status of 'unlisted'.  There are still some bookings for August and beyond that I need to negotiate cancellation and rebooking, but as I don't own the house anymore, that is a necessity and is inevitable.  If the new owners take on the listing and bookings, it will be under a new STR license and business license.

Please note that this is different from the Business Registration Certificate from the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (which needs to be renewed yearly).  Renewals are not automatic. Hosts are responsible for submitting renewal applications no earlier than 30 days before expiration. 2.	You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but a whole NEW application and application fee (the older application fee of $50 no longer applies). You may only apply if you actually live in the same dwelling unit for at least 275 nights per year (this is an important issue for us). If the property features multiple legal dwelling units, you may only host short-term rentals in the same dwelling unit where you also reside at least 275 nights per year.  3.	If you were primarily using Airbnb you should go through their website and create a new listing. As you do so, you will be prompted to apply for a short-term rental certificate through Airbnb's website. This is recommended because once you apply you should be able to legally host again while your application is pending review.   If you apply through our website or in-person, it will likely take longer (and is more complicated) to get your listing re-enabled. 4.

"Hi Edwards,  1.	Your certificate expired in 2018 and it appears you continued hosting. 2.	We don't solicit renewals for a variety of reasons including missed quarterly reports. 3.	We do not accept late reports. 4.	You have to apply with a whole new application, application fee, and recent residency documents. 5.	Since it's come up a lot this morning, coming to office in person won't expedite (nor will calling repeatedly as a few others like to do...).  6.	You can e-mail us back AFTER you have submitted the application to ask us to ask Airbnb to re-list your listings.  7.	 8.	See first link below (Become a host page, go to step 2 of 2).

Furthermore it appears the off-site meeting activity includes both the 'work' area and the upper level loft 'live' area.  Please note that continued offering/advertising/use of the space for such events will be referred (along with another similar operation at the same building) to Planning Department Code Enforcement. This will require OSTR staff to also suspend the previously issued short-term rental registration certificate.   The intent of the City's short-term rental program is to allow LIMITED short-term rental activity, in the same individual (and legal - code complying) dwelling unit where the host also resides at least 275 nights per year; while preserving long-term rental/ownership housing opportunities in dwelling units in San Francisco.   Please immediately cancel  any pending reservations for meetings/events, within four (4) days of receipt of this letter. Lastly, remove any and all online event/meeting listings. Please provide confirmation of such (e.g. cancellation of day-time event bookings) via e-mail to Omar.Masry@sfgov.org  Also, per Chapter 41A of the San Francisco Administrative Code (Business Records Upon Request Clause) please provide screenshots of individual monthly booking calendars, for all online listings (not including Peerspace) for March 2017 (yes, 2017) through May 2018; within 5 days,  to Omar.Masry@sfgov.org.   Please note this issue has also been conveyed to a similar business operator at the same overall building. ","2017-002178STR","2018-03-15 18:10:51"

"Hello Omar!  My answer is YES : )   I’ve follow the rules since day one and I’ll continue being respectful towards San Francisco’s short-term rentals host obligations. Thank you so much for contacting me this morning! Have a wonderful weekend  Warmly,  Maria Herreros  San Francisco, California.

This is Omar Masry with the City of San Francisco's Office of Short-Term Rentals.     Please affirm (respond with a 'yes' to this e-mail) that if your short-term rental registration is approved, you will:   Offer hosted stays to no more than five (5) distinct guests (example: a couple sharing a room under one short-term rental reservation would count as one distinct guest) at the same time in the home.**  Not offer overnight sleeping quarters in outdoor/rooftop areas (e.g. tents/balconies); and will not place sleeping areas in unimproved basements (if present), or locations that may block stairwells or hallways.   Not engage in unauthorized construction (e.g. addition of extra sleeping quarters/kitchens/stoves) and ensure any areas offerred for short-term rentals will be permitted by the Department of Building Inspection.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. Our goal is to work with applicants, including yourself, to promote compatible hosting activity.  **Background explanation for applicants: The City's Short-Term Rental program is intended to allow for limited short-term rental activity that does not negatively affect residential neighborhood character, and complies with other City codes (e.g. Planning and Building Codes). Offering/hosting more than five (5) separate distinct guests at the same time, may be considered an unauthorized conversion to 'Group Housing' (per consultation with the City's Zoning Administrator), and result in revocation of a short-term rental registration; and referral to Planning Department Code Enforcement.

"Hello,  I just tried to call. I wanted to let you know that I will be doing hosted stays solely for the time being and renting out my 2 upstairs bedrooms.  I stay in  the “bonus room”, which is the “knotty pine” room listed in my booking that states, in the photos “this room no longer available”; I share the bathroom with any guests. I use solely Airbnb.com.  The listing can be viewed at:  https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/689356   Can you tell me when the 90 day calendar for un-hosted stays begins again - is it Jan 1 or?  Thank you.

Apparently there has been a complaint filled on 1/29/18 against our house in regards to the AirBnB rental.  I would like to talk to you about what is the actual complaint, and who is complaining.   We have followed all the rules of City and AirBnB, we ask our guests to be polite, clean and quiet. We are living in the same house so can validate we have not had any issues with our guests and are quite frankly baffled as to WHO and WHY would complain. I would like to have a conversation with the Accuser, and understand their motives for accusation i presume these are not legal but rather personal.

While Inspector Dang is currently out of the office, we were able to meet with Senior Inspector Jose Lopez.  We provided to Mr. Lopez the invoice evidencing the work that has been completed to date and also the contract for the work that is in progress.     As mentioned, we discussed with Inspector Dang the extent of the window project and mutually agreed upon a re-inspection date of March 7.  Based on the work our contractor completes, he believes the project can be done by the end of next week. It is currently in progress. Please note that the windows are being repaired/restored and not replaced. Once completed we will be eager to advance the re-inspection for an earlier date.     Our tenant is agreeable to these terms and we have a written agreement with him to that extent. I have included Inspector Dang and Senior Inspector Lopez on this communication. Senior Inspector Lopez can include his feedback. Also included is the other property owner, my spouse, Alexey Goro.     It is our sincere hope to resolve this matter in a cooperative and efficient manner.  As an educator for the city of San Francisco, our short-term rentals provide the income we rely on to sustain ourselves. We take great pride in our home and have worked very hard to make it safe, livable and pleasant for all who are under the roof.     Thank you for your time.

"Hello Michelle,  Thank you very much for the reminder and additional information- it is greatly appreciated.    I have decided that in early March, upon my return from Asia where I am currently caring for my mother, I will no longer host my home for short term rental.  Given this, what would you advise?  I do not want to disrespect any processes but also feel that it doesn't make sense to renew given that I will no longer be renting three months from now.  There is, however, this short term gap between Jan-March.  I would appreciate any guidance and advice you can provide.  In gratitude, Tiffany 1/10/20 ***********************************************************  Hi Tiffany,   You still have a couple more weeks to make this decision whether to continue hosting or not.  By 1/31/20 if we do not receive payment, we will close out your account with us.  You can re-apply later as new application and make payment after you decided to host again.

Please confirm that you want to cancel the short-term rentals account with us.   Thanks,  Michelle ***************************************** Hi Michelle  Thanks that makes sense.

"Dear Michelle,  My name is Tracy Garber, and I have recently become the successor trustee of my aunt’s building at 1437 Kearny St. She passed away on January 18th, and I have just begun to wade through her emails and correspondence.   I do not think she hosted any short-term rentals in the second half of 2019, nor do I expect to continue any short-term rentals at the property. At a later time, however, the family may investigate the possibility of short-term rentals of her now-vacant apartment while we attempt to sell the building.   I will try to complete the paperwork that is requested here, but I may need help to know some of the information. The files that remain are not well-detailed.   Thanks for any help you can lend or advice that you think I need. In the meantime, I’ll work on the filing.   All the best,  Tracy Garber 765 S.

Otherwise, no reply is needed to this e-mail. If you continue to miss quarterly reports then the certificate will be revoked. Airbnb does not file these for you. We do not accept late reports.

I'm well aware that I cited the complaint (in reference to your prior e-mail).  Context: we often see SOME short-term rental hosts refuse to allow an inspection after a complaint because they believe it helps them avoid having a notice of violation issued. Per Chapter 41A of the SF Administrative Code (rules for Short-Term Rentals), the property needs to be free of all enforcement action, including complaints. In this instance it doesn't appear we face that type of challenge, which is good.   Please have Inspector Duffy close the actual complaint as well (see further below); and e-mail me back once he has done so. Do not advertise or host short-term rentals in the interim.

See attached final permit approval, Permit #1488946. This was managed by building inspector Donald Duffy (415-558-6120). Please note that in your letter, you cite the Complaint, not the actual Notice of Violation. In the complaint, it is cited that '2 street facing doors' were replaced without permit.  These doors did not require a permit. Only the garage door, and that has been rectified.  Mr. Duffy updated the Complaint Tracking System to indicate that the street facing doors do not require a permit.  If there are any questions at all, please contact him.  I will call you as well, but please let us know when we are clear to open the Airbnb up again for rental. You can reach me at 415-710-0245 with any questions.  Thanks.

"Hello,  I would like to close out my short term residential account. I never rented a part of my house and had closed out my business account with the city in May 2018 due to me no longer being interested in renting out my space.  As I had just received my STR in April, I did not realize there is a required quarterly report with your department separate from TOT and the business account (which again I had closed completely, very soon after receiving my STR). Please let me know the process on how to close this, so that I will not be responsible for quarterly reports (which will always be 0).  I was only able to access the website today, and was unable to file no stays for the previous quarter.   Thank you, Deanna Chan STR-0002775 1442 22nd Avenue ","2018-000374STR","2018-08-21 18:22:29"

I do want to note we are working through your application, but I do have a concern with something you said in the e-mail below.   You indicated your listing was 'absolutely legal.'     While I understand the sincere intent of your statement, I do have to note that it appears you have an un-permitted kitchen sink and kitchen counter.  This issue is still a valid concern even if the space was built by a prior property owner.  I have not reviewed prior building permits at this time. So, if a certificate is issued and we receive a complaint (whether from a neighbor down the street or across town), in the future, and it appear the space is not previously permitted, we would need to suspend the registration if the space is not in compliance with prior building permits OR the Planning Department's Rooms Down Bulletin.  Please note that we have had to deny many applications for un-permitted units; so this is not a selective discussion, but I do want to make you aware of the concern.  In the long run you may want to consider legalized the unit as a separate dwelling unit using the Department of Building Inspection's Unit Legalization Program. This would allow you to add a stove/range if you desire. However, short-term rentals would not be allowed in that space since it would be a formal second unit.  Do not remove any unpermitted kitchen sinks/stoves/counters without permits from the Department of Building Inspection.  Also, do not use the garage as a short-term rental living/sleeping space.

Remove all (online) listings that advertise your short-term rental, and cancel pending short-term rental reservations for stays of less than 30 days. 2.      Fill out this form with the Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector<https://etaxstatement.sfgov.org/accountupdate> to declare that you are no longer hosting. 3.

No, they are not automatic. Is the fee the same?   Effective October 1, 2019 the short-term rental application fee is $450. If my listing is being blocked by Airbnb/VRBO/HomeAway, what should I do? After submitting your application, please e-mail us with your street address, name, and the listing information (listing identification number or listing description). We will ask the website (hosting platform) to re-list the listing for you. Do I need to provide all new dual proofs of residency? Yes, please. What should I do if there are unresolved Building Code/Planning Code/Fire Code complaints against my property? You may not continue to host/advertise/offer short-term rentals. Please work with Building/Fire/Planning to resolve the complaint. Please do not re-apply until after the complaint has been fully resolved (including final inspections of any building permits, if required, to resolve the complaint). Does this have anything to do with hotel taxes (transient occupancy taxes), or the 571-R form I received in the mail?  No, it does not. While you still need to maintain a separate business registration certificate with the SF Treasurer and Tax Collector's Office, the collection of hotel taxes, or business personal property taxes (tied to the 571-R form host receive by USPS mail) is handled separately with their Office. Our Office (OSTR) cannot provide tax advice. If you have questions about issues related to hotel taxes and business registration, please call SF 311, or visit the Tax Collector at the 1st floor at City Hall. The 571-R form (for business personal property taxes) is administered by the Assessor-Recorder's Office (which is located at the 1st floor of City Hall. in a different room than the Tax Collector's office).

"Note to property owners: A separate short-term rental certificate for Garrett Vygantas has been closed, as only one certificate, tied to one host, can be issued for each legal dwelling unit. It appears this property features only one (1) legal dwelling unit and one likely unpermitted “lower” unit (with full bathroom, gas stove, kitchen sink and counter). We cannot issue a 2nd concurrent short-term rental certificate for the same individual dwelling unit. The owners are encouraged to legalize the space, if possible, as an Accessory Dwelling Unit.","2018-004863STR","2020-04-13 14:55:30"

"Hi. A couple items I would like to share.   You referred to the property as a multi-unit building. There was a previous history of illegal units in the basement back in 2013.   I don't get the sense there's only one kitchen at the property now. If you believe otherwise, feel free to let me know or call me.   Semi-separately:     The City's short-term rental program does NOT require the owner to live on-site.     So for instance, a long-term renter may apply as well (about 11% of our approved hosts are renters); as long as they actually live in the same dwelling unit at least 275 nights per year. So hypothetically, a renter could rent a 6 bedroom house, get a certificate from our Office, live year-round, in one bedroom, and have 5 different Airbnb private room listings for 5 different couples (for example) staying at the same time.     In this instance, it APPEARS Brian lives on-site and was renting out 3 different private bedrooms at the same time. If you look at guest reviews there is quite a bit of mention of his mom being present. I have not conducted a site visit. I went to the site once (see below) to issue a notice of violation (posters on outside of building) and penalties were paid.

I don’t know if the owner lives at the building or not.  I see a person who may be the owner occasionally, but I can’t tell if he sleeps there.

No postings exist...no interest in doing this again.  I could not find the form you referenced below....so I am emailing instead.   If you are no longer conducting short-term rentals, please complete the following steps so that we can close out your certificate appropriately.   1.         Remove all (online) listings that advertise your short-term rental, and cancel pending short-term rental reservations for stays of less than 30 days. ALL REMOVED FOR YEARS NOW   2.         Fill out this form with the Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector to declare that you are no longer hosting. CANNOT FIND FORM   3.         Complete this form with the Office of the Assessor-Recorder. Depending on the date of your business closure, you may still need to declare business personal property taxes for the current year. Business personal property taxes are separate from hotel taxes (transient occupancy taxes). CANNOT FIND FORM; HAVE NOT HAD INCOME SINCE 2018   4.

If you have already mailed in your quarterly report, then please ignore this e-mail.                          HAVE YOU MOVED OR NO LONGER HOSTING RENTALS FOR LESS THAN 30 DAYS?                         If you have moved or are no longer hosting short-term rentals, then please e-mail us to withdraw your short-term rental certificate.                          You may also want to close your separate business registration with the SF Tax Collector (link).                          Important reminders: To remain in good standing, you need to report quarterly stays to our Office, even if you use a hosting platform (website) that remits hotel taxes for you. This is a separate requirement from tax reporting.  In addition, if you have had no short-term stays this last quarter, you still need to indicate no guest stays in your quarterly reports.                          A few notes                          REPORTING HOSTED vs. UNHOSTED GUEST STAYS                         Hosted stays are guest stays where you are staying overnight in the same legal dwelling unit when the guest stays are occurring.                                                     Unhosted guest stays are guest stays where you are not present overnight during the guest stay (limit of 90 cumulative unhosted rentals per calendar year).                          '571-R FORM'                         Please note that hosts will typically receive a 571-R form from the Office of The SF Assessor-Recorder once a year. The Office of Short-Term Rentals does not administer this program. Please contact the Assessor-Recorder for any questions or visit their website (link).

"To maintain good standing on the registry, all registered hosts are required to file quarterly reports every quarter, even if they didn’t host any stays for that specific quarter.  Failure to report on a consistent basis can be grounds for certificate revocation. Missing one report its not grounds for revocation, and as long as you work to file your reports going forward it should not be an issue. Currently, the online reporting is open, but we do not accept any late reporting forms. If you wish, you can file a paper report (blank form attached), and it will be added to your file, but it will not count as being on record or logged into the database; so you will not see it under your report history when you log on to your account.

Do not open links or attachments from untrusted sources.     Hello -     Airbnb was unable to resolve the issues with my previous apartment listing (listing ID 578097), so I duplicated it (same address, same photos) in an attempt to start over.  The new listing ID is 33935116.  (To be honest, I'd much prefer to keep the old listing, since it has 20 5-star reviews, but in any case I'll only keep one - I only rent my place when I'm out of town and will never get near the limit of 45 or 60 days or whatever the limit is right now.)     When creating a new listing, Airbnb only asks for my Small Business Registration number and the receipt for the $250 application fee for Short-Term Rentals.  I wasn't given the opportunity to enter my STR number, even though I have it.  Anyway, I feel terrible that I may be creating work for people, but after trying for a month I gave up on ever successfully reactivating my old listing.  In case anyone needs it, I've attached my small business registration, the receipt for the $250 fee, and my STR certificate.     Thanks!

This is the Airbnb listing for my apartment - my primary residence, which I only list when we're out of town.   In late 2018 I tried to register, but didn't understand the process and entered my small business number rather than my STR number, so my initial application was rejected; after several failed attempts to correct the issue I created a new listing, then took it down when it seemed like everything was going to get sorted out after all. After all this back and forth, my registration was finally approved - see confirmation email attached, from May 4th.     Today I received an email that my registration was NOT approved, but there's no explanation for why not.  I've only rented my place out for 5 days in all of 2019, so I don't think I'm in violation of any regulations.  My STR is in good standing, as far as I know (I've attached my small business registration and a scan of the certificate as well).

"To maintain good standing on the registry, all registered hosts are required to file quarterly reports every quarter, even if they didn’t host any stays for that specific quarter.  Failure to report on a consistent basis can be grounds for certificate revocation. Missing one report its not grounds for revocation, and as long as you work to file your reports going forward it should not be an issue. Currently, the online reporting is open, but we do not accept any late reporting forms. If you wish, you can file a paper report (blank form attached), and it will be added to your file, but it will not count as being on record or logged into the database; so you will not see it under your report history when you log on to your account.

"2362 Folsom Street CPC-ShortTermRentals dana genshaft <dana.genshaft@gmail.com> It does not appear we ever received a complete application for that SPECIFIC address.    You appear to have been operating illegally.   It does appear you received a business registration from the Tax Collector, but did not submit for a short-term residential rental certificate.     please note the following:   You may not host/advertise/offer short-term rentals (stays of less than 30 days per guest/reservation) unless you have a valid certificate OR a pending application with our Office.  You may re-apply to host short-term rentals, but only if you actually live in the residential unit at least 275 nights per year. This is a primary requirement.  If you intend to re-apply online today you have two primary options (See Item 4 for the second option) as shown below. You would need to file a new application with current application fee and recent dual proofs of residency:  Apply online through the OSTR website (skip step 1 if your business registration certificate with the Tax Collector is still valid at this address) with a complete application. http://businessportal.sfgov.org/forms/short-term-rental-intro  Short-Term Residential Rental Application | SF Business Portal businessportal.sfgov.org The San Francisco Business Portal is the ultimate resource for starting, running, and growing a business in our City. With comprehensive information and tailored tools, the portal helps you navigate the process and quickly learn what it takes to be compliant.     After you have submitted a complete application, please e-mail shorttermrentals@sfgov.org with your address (including unit number), a statement that you have re-applied, and the prior listing ID/link/name that was de-listed.  OSTR staff will then ask the hosting platform to re-list the listing. Please note this may take between 3-10 days to go through.  However, if you only plan to host short-term rentals through Airbnb, you can also try creating a new Airbnb listing today, which will lead you to their pass-through registration program within Airbnb's website. This will send the application to our Office electronically and typically allow you to start hosting right away.

"From: Mally, Adrienne <Adrienne@a3nstrategies.com>  Sent: Sunday, December 22, 2019 7:50 PM To: CPC-ShortTermRentals <shorttermrentals@sfgov.org> Subject: Long term rental and closed SF Business account  RE: Residency Requirement & retired Business Acct. Number  New Registered Short-term Residential Rental Certificate # STR-0003958  Hi,  I hope you can help me. I originally applied for Short Term Rental Certification in February 2019 to help pay my share of unexpected maintenance and repairs to the flat that I have owned and lived in for 22 years. I fulfilled all the requirements, paid all the fees and opened a Business Acct.  I am over 65, have no job and was counting on being able to do short term rentals to help pay these and other fees and expenses. However, without the certification, I could do nothing.  When I still didn't have Certification by August, I finally gave up waiting and worked with someone at the City who helped me close the Business Account. so I wouldn't have to pay renewal fees (that were due after only 4 months!!!), penalties, and taxes while still waiting to be able to make any money. (I contacted the Short Term Rental office several times but each time I received a form email saying they could not tell me when or if I would receive certification. Real Estate agents told me I could not list the room in my apt without the certificate number.)     Because I still need rental revenue to help pay bills, I moved out and found someone who wanted to rent my flat furnished on a long-term (more than 30 days) basis.   I finally received my Short term Rental Certification in mid-November 2019 but now, because of the long term lease, I cannot move back until August 2020 and I no longer have an active business account number with the City.  I may never get a chance to do short term rentals but I am reluctant to cancel the certification which took so long and cost so much to get--especially since I might need to use it before November 2021.  Can you  give me some advice or information on what my options and costs might be?  Thank you, Happy Holidays!

"Hello Mr Guy: I called Alvin Wong last fall and tried to cancel our never-used Airbnb and he said I had to call the city office for transient occupancy which I guess is your office.  I came in this afternoon to see someone but was unable to see anyone from room 400.  The front office gave me the phone numbers of yourself and Milton Marvin. I left two messages. I can not come in for a 'walk-in' appointment tonight at 5:30. I want this account closed. I have paid fees up front and some fees last summer for an account I had great trouble opening and more problems to close. Never had guests. Please close this location number  1217704-04-191 and the business account number is under my wife's name Frances Verrinder  and that number is 0173198.  She and I also have a business license under the same number for psychotherapy which we want to keep active.. Last night I closed the business tax number for the Airbnb portion retroactively back to Sept 2, 2019 which was far back as it would let me go. Please update my situation.  I received the email from your department last night and was alarmed that I might be liable for more taxes.   We have never had clients stay at our home here.
